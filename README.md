Related: [Transcoder for Craft 2.x](https://github.com/nystudio107/transcoder)

**Note**: _The license fee for this plugin is $59.00 via the Craft Plugin Store._

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To install Transcoder, follow these steps:

1. Install with Composer via `composer require nystudio107/craft-transcoder` from your project directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins

You can also install Transcoder via the **Plugin Store** in the Craft Control Panel.

Transcoder works on Craft 3.x.

You will also need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed for Transcoder to work. On Ubuntu 16.04, you can do just:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

To install `ffmpeg` on Centos 6/7, you can follow the guide [How to Install FFmpeg on CentOS](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-centos)

If you have managed hosting, contact your sysadmin to get `ffmpeg` installed.

## Transcoder Overview

The Transcoder plugin allows you to transcode any video or animated gif (local or remote) to any size, bitrate, framerate, and save it out as a web-ready video in a variety of file formats.

It can also transcode audio files to any bitrate & sample rate, to a variety of file formats. It can even extract audio tracks from video files.

Transcoder also allows you to get a thumbnail of a video in any size and at any timecode, and can extract information about audio/video files such. It also automatically adds video thumbnails in the Assets index in the Control Panel.

Finally, it lets you download an arbitrary file (such as the transcoded video) via a special download link.

If the source file has changed since the last time the video/audio was transcoded, it will re-encode the file and replace it.

## Configuring Transcoder

The only configuration for Transcoder is in the `config.php` file, which is a multi-environment friendly way to store the default settings.  Don't edit this file, instead copy it to `craft/config` as `transcoder.php` and make your changes there.

## Using Transcoder

### Generating a Transcoded Video

To generate a transcoded video, do the following:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

You can also pass in an URL:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('http://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4', {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

You can also pass in an `Asset`:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl(myAsset, {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

It will return to you a URL to the transcoded video if it already exists, or if it doesn't exist, it will return `""` and kick off the transcoding process (which can be quite lengthy for long videos).

In the array you pass in, the default values are used if the key/value pair does not exist:

    {
        "videoEncoder" => "h264",
        "videoBitRate" => "800k",
        "videoFrameRate" => 15,
        "aspectRatio" => "letterbox",
        "sharpen" => true,
    }

These default values come from the `config.php` file.

If you want to have the Transcoder not change a parameter, pass in an empty value in the key/value pair, e.g.:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "frameRate": "",
        "bitRate": ""
    }) %}

The above example would cause it to not change the frameRate or bitRate of the source video (not recommended for client-proofing purposes).

The `aspectRatio` parameter lets you control how the video aspect ratio is maintained when it is scaled:

`none` results in the aspect ratio of the original video not being maintained, and the video scaled to the dimensions passed in:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_none.jpg)

`crop` scales the video up to maintain the original aspect ratio, and then crops it so that it's full-frame:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_crop.jpg)

`letterbox` scales the video to fit the new frame, putting a letterboxed or pillarboxed border to pad it:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_letterbox.jpg)

You can control the color of the letterboxed area (it's `black` by default) via the `letterboxColor` option. It can be either a semantic color name, or a hexcode color, e.g.: `0xC0C0C0`

The `sharpen` option determines whether an unsharp mask filter should be applied to the scaled video.

The file format setting `videoEncoder` is preset to what you'll need to generate `h264` videos, but it can also generate `webm` videos, or any other format that `ffmpeg` supports. See the `config.php` file for details

Transcoder will also automatically add video thumbnails in the Control Panel Asset index.

### Generating a Transcoded Audio File

To generate a transcoded audio File, do the following:

    {% set transAudioUrl = craft.transcoder.getAudioUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/podcast.mp3', {
        "audioBitRate": "64k",
        "audioSampleRate": 22050,
        "audioChannels": 1
    }) %}

You can also pass in a URL:

    {% set transAudioUrl = craft.transcoder.getAudioUrl('http://www.noiseaddicts.com/samples_1w72b820/2514.mp3', {
        "audioBitRate": "64k",
        "audioSampleRate": 22050,
        "audioChannels": 1
    }) %}

You can also pass in an `Asset`:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set transAudioUrl = craft.transcoder.getAudioUrl(myAsset, {
        "audioBitRate": "64k",
        "audioSampleRate": 22050,
        "audioChannels": 1
    }) %}

It will return to you a URL to the transcoded audio file if it already exists, or if it doesn't exist, it will return `""` and kick off the transcoding process (which can be somewhat lengthy for long audio files).

In the array you pass in, the default values are used if the key/value pair does not exist:

    {
        "audioEncoder" => "mp3",
        "audioBitRate" => "128k",
        "audioSampleRate" => "44100",
        "audioChannels" => "2",
    }

These default values come from the `config.php` file.

If you want to have the Transcoder not change a parameter, pass in an empty value in the key/value pair, e.g.:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/trimurti.mp4', {
        "audioBitRate": "",
        "audioSampleRate": "",
        "audioChannels": ""
    }) %}

The above example would cause it to not change the audio of the source audio file at all (not recommended for client-proofing purposes).

The file format setting `audioEncoder` is preset to what you'll need to generate `mp3` audio files, but it can also generate `aac`, `ogg`, or any other format that `ffmpeg` supports. See the `config.php` file for details

### Generating a Transcoded Video

To generate a transcoded video, do the following:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

You can also pass in an URL:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('http://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4', {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

You can also pass in an `Asset`:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl(myAsset, {
        "videoFrameRate": 20,
        "videoBitRate": "500k",
        "width": 720,
        "height": 480
    }) %}

It will return to you a URL to the transcoded video if it already exists, or if it doesn't exist, it will return `""` and kick off the transcoding process (which can be quite lengthy for long videos).

In the array you pass in, the default values are used if the key/value pair does not exist:

    {
        "videoEncoder" => "h264",
        "videoBitRate" => "800k",
        "videoFrameRate" => 15,
        "aspectRatio" => "letterbox",
        "sharpen" => true,
    }

These default values come from the `config.php` file.

If you want to have the Transcoder not change a parameter, pass in an empty value in the key/value pair, e.g.:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "frameRate": "",
        "bitRate": ""
    }) %}

The above example would cause it to not change the frameRate or bitRate of the source video (not recommended for client-proofing purposes).

The `aspectRatio` parameter lets you control how the video aspect ratio is maintained when it is scaled:

`none` results in the aspect ratio of the original video not being maintained, and the video scaled to the dimensions passed in:

Transcoder will also automatically add video thumbnails in the Control Panel Asset index.

### Getting Transcoding Progress

Transcoding of video/audio files can take quite a bit of time, so Transcoder provides you with a way to get the status of any currently running transcoding operation via `craft.transcoder.getVideoProgressUrl()` or `craft.transcoder.getAudioProgressUrl()`. For example:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set videoOptions = {
        "videoFrameRate": 60,
        "videoBitRate": "1000k",
        "width": 1000,
        "height": 800,
        "aspectRatio": "none",
    } %}
    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl(myAsset, videoOptions) %}
    {% set progressUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoProgressUrl(myAsset, videoOptions) %}

The variable `progressUrl` in the example above is set to a URL will return a JSON array of data indicating the current progress of the transcoding:
 
     {
       "filename": "oceans_1000kbps_60fps_1000w_800h_letterbox.mp4",
       "duration": 46.61,
       "time": 37.69,
       "progress": 81
     }

* `filename` - the name of the file
* `duration` - the duration of the video/audio stream
* `time` - the time of the current encoding
* `progress` - a percentage indicating how much of the encoding is done

You can use this information to provide a progress bar via JavaScript or from a plugin.

### Generating a Video Thumbnail

To generate a thumbnail from a video, do the following:

    {% set transVideoThumbUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoThumbnailUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "width": 300,
        "height": 200,
        "timeInSecs": 20,
    }) %}

You can also pass in a URL:

    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl('http://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4', {
        "width": 300,
        "height": 200,
        "timeInSecs": 20,
    }) %}

You can also pass in an `Asset`:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set transVideoUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoUrl(myAsset, {
        "width": 300,
        "height": 200,
        "timeInSecs": 20,
    }) %}

It will return to you a URL to the thumbnail of the video, in the size you specify, from the timecode `timeInSecs` in the video.  It creates this thumbnail immediately if it doesn't already exist.

In the array you pass in, the default values are used if the key/value pair does not exist:

    {
        "width" => 200,
        "height" => 100,
        "timeInSecs" => 10,
        "aspectRatio" => "letterbox",
        "sharpen" => true,
    }

If you want to have the Transcoder not change a parameter, pass in an empty value in the key/value pair, e.g.:

    {% set transVideoThumbUrl = craft.transcoder.getVideoThumbnailUrl('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', {
        "width": "",
        "height": "",
        "timeInSecs": 20,
    }) %}

The above example would cause it to generate a thumbnail at whatever size the video is (not recommended for client-proofing purposes).

The `aspectRatio` parameter lets you control how the video aspect ratio is maintained when it is scaled:

`none` results in the aspect ratio of the original video not being maintained, and the thumbnail image is scaled to the dimensions passed in:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_none.jpg)

`crop` scales the video up to maintain the original aspect ratio, and then crops it so that the thumbnail image is full-frame:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_crop.jpg)

`letterbox` scales the video to fit the new frame, putting a letterboxed or pillarboxed border to pad the thumbnail image:

![Screenshot](resources/screenshots/oceans_20s_300w_200h_letterbox.jpg)

You can control the color of the letterboxed area (it's `black` by default) via the `letterboxColor` option. It can be either a semantic color name, or a hexcode color, e.g.: `0xC0C0C0`

The `sharpen` option determines whether an unsharp mask filter should be applied to the scaled thumbnail image.

### Getting Information About a Video/Audio File

To get information about an existing video/audio file, you can use `craft.transcoder.getFileInfo()`:

    {% set fileInfo = craft.transcoder.getFileInfo('/home/vagrant/sites/nystudio107/public/oceans.mp4', true) %}

You can also pass in a URL:

    {% set fileInfo = craft.transcoder.getFileInfo('http://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4', true) %}

You can also pass in an `Asset`:

    {% set myAsset = entry.someAsset.one() %}
    {% set fileInfo = craft.transcoder.getFileInfo(myAsset, true) %}

By passing in `true` as the second argument, we get just a summary of the video/audio file information in an array:

    [
        'videoEncoder' => 'h264'
        'videoBitRate' => '3859635'
        'videoFrameRate' => 23.976023976024
        'height' => 400
        'width' => 960
        'audioEncoder' => 'aac'
        'audioBitRate' => '92926'
        'audioSampleRate' => '48000'
        'audioChannels' => 2
        'filename' => '/htdocs/craft3/public/assets/oceans.mp4'
        'duration' => '46.613333'
        'size' => '23014356'
    ]

If you instead pass in `false` as the second parameter (or omit it), then `craft.transcoder.getFileInfo()` returns the full video/audio file info an array with two top-level keys:

* `format` - information about the container file format
* `streams` - information about each stream in the container; many videos have multiple streams, for instance, one for the video streams, and another for the audio stream. There can even be multiple video or audio streams in a container.

Here's example output from `craft.transcoder.getFileInfo()`:

### Generating a Download URL

To generate a download URL for a file, do the following:

    {% set downloadUrl = craft.transcoder.getDownloadUrl('/some/url') %}

When the user clicks on the URL, it will download the file to their local computer.  If the file doesn't exist, `""` is returned.

The file must reside in the webroot (thus a URL or URI must be passed in as a parameter, not a path), for security reasons.

## Transcoder Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

* Add a console command for doing encodings via console
* Figure out a way to reliably do multi-pass video encoding
* Add audio normalization via `loudnorm` http://k.ylo.ph/2016/04/04/loudnorm.html
